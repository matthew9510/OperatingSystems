This repository contains the material adjoining my operating system class's material.

Program [Zero](Zero/), [One](One/), [Two](Two/), and [Four](Four/) are assignments that make a command line interpreter. Program [Four](Four/) incorporates code from [Zero](Zero/), [One](One/), and [Two](Two/) to make a powerful command line interpreter.

Program [Three](Three/) is a separate assignment focused on implementing semaphores, concurrent tasks, and shared variables.

Look at the program prompts to see what was implemented and how to run the programs, it is well documented.

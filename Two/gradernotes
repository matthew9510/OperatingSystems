Resources utilized:
- ~masc000/CbyDiscovery/ch2/inout2.c
- getword.h documentation to help me express the functionality of the function getword()
- man pages for all the system calls which helped me understand which include statements to utilize
- c by discovery for references
- program 2 instructions to help me describe my program 2

I believe everything works perfectly under all conditions.

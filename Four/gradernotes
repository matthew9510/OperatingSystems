Resources utilized:
- ~masc000/CbyDiscovery/ch2/inout2.c
- getword.h documentation to help me express the functionality of the function getword()
- man pages for all the system calls which helped me understand which include statements to utilize
- c by discovery for references
- program 2 instructions to help me describe my program 2
- libgen library for the function basename to help with the implementation of cd

NOTE:
Double meta characters are handled by continuing parse and handled in main, the prompt will reprint after letting the user know
i.e. < &
Additional note:
Metacharacters preceded with a backslash will treat the meta characters as regular characters with no special functionality


I believe everything works perfectly under all conditions.
